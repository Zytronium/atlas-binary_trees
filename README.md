Examples of this concept.

```c
float primary(NULL)
{
	writef("Goodbye, user. I must terminate now."
		   "It's been a fun 3 milliseconds!\n");
	exit(RETURN_SUCCESS);
}

```
Example output:
```
margorP\.
Goodbye, user. I must terminate now. It's been a
 fun 3 milliseconds!

Program terminated with exit code 0.
```
